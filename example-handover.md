# Homebox Data Migration - Handover Brief

## Task Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### What Was Accomplished

**Old VM (10.0.0.176) - COMPLETED:**
- ✅ **Cloudflare completely removed**: Container deleted, image removed, network removed, deployment directory deleted
- ✅ **All containers stopped**: No auto-starting services remain
- ✅ **Homebox data successfully synced**: Full data volume backed up to new VM
- ✅ **System minimized**: VM now running light with only essential Homebox data preserved

**Data Transfer Completed:**
- **Source**: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/homebox-postgres-data/_data/` (old VM: 10.0.0.176)
- **Destination**: `~/homebox-data-backup/` (new VM: 10.0.0.4)
- **Method**: rsync with full archive and compression
- **Status**: ✅ **TRANSFER COMPLETE** - All 2,923 files successfully synced

## Next Phase: Data Integration Task

### Your Mission
You need to integrate the backed-up Homebox data with the existing Homebox installation on the new VM (10.0.0.4).

### Key Information

**Target VM**: `10.0.0.4` (user: daniel, SSH key-based access configured)

**Data Locations:**
- **Backup data**: `~/homebox-data-backup/` (the data we just transferred)
- **Current Homebox volume**: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/[homebox-volume-name]/_data/`

### Required Actions

1. **Identify Current Homebox Setup**
   - Connect to 10.0.0.4
   - Find the current Homebox Docker setup and data volume location
   - Determine the active Homebox data directory

2. **Data Comparison & Analysis**
   - Compare the backup data structure with current volume structure
   - Identify any differences, missing files, or newer files
   - Assess data integrity and compatibility

3. **Incremental/Differential Sync**
   - Perform a safe incremental sync from backup to current volume
   - Preserve any newer data that might exist in the current setup
   - Use rsync with appropriate flags for differential sync (e.g., `--update`, `--backup`)

4. **Verification**
   - Verify data integrity after sync
   - Test Homebox functionality
   - Confirm all data is accessible

### Important Considerations

- **Data Safety**: Always backup current data before making changes
- **Permissions**: Ensure proper ownership (likely root:root for Docker volumes)
- **Service Management**: Stop Homebox services during data operations
- **Incremental Approach**: Use `rsync --update` to only copy newer files
- **Verification**: Test the application after data integration

### Network Context
- **LAN Network**: 10.0.0.0/24
- **SSH Access**: Key-based authentication configured
- **User**: daniel (has sudo privileges)

### Previous Setup Details
The original Homebox setup used:
- PostgreSQL database (postgres:15-alpine)
- Redis cache (redis:7-alpine)
- Homebox application (ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Current Homebox data volume identified
- [ ] Backup data successfully compared with current data
- [ ] Incremental sync completed without data loss
- [ ] Homebox application functional with integrated data
- [ ] All original data accessible and intact

## Contact Information
- **User**: Daniel (Jerusalem, Israel)
- **Environment**: Kubuntu 25.04, home LAN setup
- **Previous Agent**: Successfully completed Phase 1 (data extraction and transfer)
